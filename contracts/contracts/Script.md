## Preparation

### Accounts
1. Ensure we have an account from Web3Auth (we can show this separately to demonstrate funding).
2. Fund the account with 1,000 NZDT.
3. Fund the account with Sepolia ETH.
4. Ensure we have a merchant address funded with ETH.

### Apps

1. Open the app on the login screen.
2. Open another browser tab running the merchant side.
3. Log into the merchant account and have it ready.
4. Grant permissions to use the laptop screen so we can skip that.
5. Open a tab with Etherscan to show the funds appearing.

## Demo

### Sign In
- Walk through the Web3Auth flow. (Note: We plan to reskin these screens as much as possible later.)
- Pause while we find the account and fund it.

### Main Menu

- ? Optionally point out the balance.
- Select the denomination.
- Confirm and print the transaction (is this asynchronous?).
- While the transaction is being mined, explain what is happening from a technical perspective.

  A private/public key pair is generated.

  The public key is written to the chain.

  The amount is transferred from the users wallet to the contract.

  The private key is printed on the note.

#### Switch to Merchant UI

- Scan the QR code.
- Redeem the transaction.
- While the transaction is being mined, explain what is happening

The a signature is generated using the qr code (the private key of the note)

The message that is signed is the account number of the merchant.

This is presented to the smart contract 

The smart contract checks the signature is from the banknote (yes)

The smart contract checks that the message that was signed is the address of the sender.

- Now show that the funds have been credited to the merchant
  
#### Switch to ATM UI

- Show that the balance has changed
- Show more features.
- Click on "Deposit."
- Demonstrate adding funds—launch MoonPay if possible, but don’t go through the full process.
- Talk through other features until the 2-minute mark.

## Introduction

Hi, we are Team Skeuomorphia, a group spanning four continents. We present to you a way to demystify crypto for senior members of the community.

### Skeuomorphia

Something is **skeuomorphic** when it uses a familiar object to represent a new innovation. While this approach is usually frowned upon in design circles. But we see it as a tool.

### Why?

Because crypto is scary, and we need to break down that barrier. We want to make it familiar and even fun—not as an end goal, but as a stepping stone into the more exciting world of Web3.

The median age in the US is nearly 40 and rising. As we get older, what might seem "boring" can actually be an advantage, and fancy interfaces can become a burden.

## Epilog

But isn't this just creating a banking service with an outdated UI? And using physical representations, which is medieval tech?

**Exactly!**

We have demonstrated that crypto doesn't need to be scary—it's just about moving money around. It's just another bank... 

But...

- It’s a bank with no staff or buildings.
- It’s a bank that you can own a part of, simply by using it.
- It’s a bank that can handle all your assets, not just your local currency.
